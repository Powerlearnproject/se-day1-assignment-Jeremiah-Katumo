Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the process of designing, developing and maintaining sofwatres and it helps in developing reliable, flexible, efficient and scalable software solutions to meet the needs of users and businesses effectively.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Structured programming - this started with languages like c plain. It focused on more organized and logical code that is easier to read, understand and debug. 
2. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - This brought the idea of working with objects in programming thus helping to reuse code.
3. Agile methodologies - This emphasizes on iterative development, collaboration and rapid feedback loops, adapting to changing requirements more effectively.
4. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. One should think about **planning** by defining the main problem that is supposed to be solved and state all the requirements for solving the problem
2. Design is an **important** bit as it helps in designing the software to be created after idefying the problem and requirements for its solution.
3. Write code. **Coding** is the process of writing instructions using programming OOP languages to solve or perform a certain functonality in a software.
4. **Testing** the quality an functionality of the coded sofware is important.
5. Afterwards, **Deployment** is the process making the software available to the internet for users.
6. **Maintaing** the software and trying to fix any bugs arising as a result of being used by users. The fixing of bugs or even updating the software to other languages if possible to enhance the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is ideal for well-defined projects with minimal expected changes while Agile is an iterative and flexible approach that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the development process, making it better suited for projects with changing requirements and uncertain conditions.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. QA or quality assurance engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before it is deployed.
2. The project manager may include helping the team to design, execute, monitor and finish their work so that the clients will receive higher-quality software products.
3. Software developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. Aside from coding, a software developer is responsible for sending updates to the project manager and working closely with other team members, including the designer and QA engineer. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs like vscode provide comprehensive set of tools that help in writing code, debugging it and even testing in just a single interface. 
Version Control Systems like Git a famously used VCS helps to track changes in code for example log different previous commits over time, collaboration with fellow developers. You can even rollback if its a necessity

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Deadlines. The team should ensure they complete their tasks on time in order to meet deadlines and moving forward.
2. System Integration. Bugs can be revealed that were missed earlier in building the software.
3. Keeping up with tech. The developer is required to constantly learn

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation.
   Purpose:
     Ensures that individual units (functions, classes, or methods) work as expected.    
     Helps solve bugs while in the development cycle.
3. Integration testing examines how multiple components or modules interact with each other.
   Purpose:
     Detects interface defects between modules.
     Validates data flow between components.
     Ensures that integrated modules function as intended.
4. System testing evaluates the complete software application as a whole. It ensures that the system meets functional and non-functional requirements.
   Purpose:
     Validates overall system behavior and performance.
     Checks interactions with external dependencies (databases, APIs).
     Tests security, usability, and reliability.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- The process of writing instructions to guide an AI model to predict specific responses and making it accurate and attain the required performance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Talk to me about cars?
Improved prompt: Explain to me about Audi R9, its speed, appearance, size and price?
The improved prompt will give you a more effective response as it has a clear scope, specific focus area, concise and direct.
